#### Overview

The `Vector2` type is a fundamental data structure in the Swiperia library, representing a two-dimensional vector. This type is used extensively across the library to denote positions, movements, and other vector-related calculations in a 2D space.

#### Type Definition

```ts
export type Vector2 = [number, number];
```

#### Description

`Vector2` is defined as a tuple of two numbers:

* The first element (`number`) represents the x-coordinate or the horizontal component of the vector.
* The second element (`number`) represents the y-coordinate or the vertical component of the vector.

#### Usage

The `Vector2` type is primarily used to represent coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, making it suitable for various applications including but not limited to:

* Specifying positions and movements in graphical interfaces.
* Calculating distances and directions between points.
* Implementing physics and other simulation systems where 2D vector operations are required.

#### Examples

**Position Representation**

```ts
// Represents a point at coordinates (150, 75) on a 2D plane
const point: Vector2 = [150, 75];
```

**Movement Vector**

```ts
// Represents a movement vector that moves 30 units right and 20 units up
const movement: Vector2 = [30, -20];
```

**Function Parameter**

```ts
// Function that calculates the magnitude of a 2D vector
function vectorMagnitude(vector: Vector2): number {
  return Math.sqrt(vector[0] ** 2 + vector[1] ** 2);
}

const magnitude = vectorMagnitude([3, 4]);  // Returns 5
```
