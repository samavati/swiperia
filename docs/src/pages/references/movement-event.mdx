#### Overview

The `MovementEvent` type is a comprehensive data structure used in the Swiperia library to represent the details of a movement, typically a swipe gesture. This type encapsulates various metrics and properties that describe the dynamics and characteristics of the movement.

#### Type Definition

```ts
export interface MovementEvent {
  direction: SwipeDirection | null;
  source: Vector2;
  target: Vector2;
  deltaX: number;
  deltaY: number;
  absX: number;
  absY: number;
  velocity: number;
  vxvy: Vector2;
  distance: number;
}
```

#### Description

`MovementEvent` includes the following properties:

* **direction (`SwipeDirection | null`)**: Specifies the primary [direction](/references/swipe-direction) of the movement (right, left, up, down) or null if not applicable.
* **source (`Vector2`)**: The starting point of the movement, represented as a [2D vector](/references/vector-2).
* **target (`Vector2`)**: The ending point of the movement, also represented as a [2D vector](/references/vector-2).
* **deltaX (`number`)**: The horizontal displacement of the movement. Positive values indicate a rightward movement, while negative values indicate a leftward movement.
* **deltaY (`number`)**: The vertical displacement of the movement. Positive values indicate a downward movement, while negative values indicate an upward movement.
* **absX (`number`)**: The absolute value of deltaX, representing the total horizontal distance traveled, regardless of direction.
* **absY (`number`)**: The absolute value of deltaY, representing the total vertical distance traveled, regardless of direction.
* **velocity (`number`)**: The overall speed of the movement, calculated as the Euclidean distance traveled divided by the time taken.
* **vxvy (`Vector2`)**: The velocity components along the x and y axes, respectively. check [2D vector](/references/vector-2) for more clientInformation.
* **distance (`number`)**: The straight-line (Euclidean) distance between the source and target points.

#### Usage

The `MovementEvent` type is used to provide detailed information about a movement event, such as a swipe. It is essential for applications that need to analyze or respond to such movements, providing all necessary metrics to implement responsive and intuitive interactions.

#### Examples

**Handling a Movement Event**

```ts
function processMovement(event: MovementEvent) {
  console.log(`Moved from ${event.source} to ${event.target} with a velocity of ${event.velocity}`);
  if (event.direction) {
    console.log(`Direction of movement: ${event.direction}`);
  }
}

const movementEvent: MovementEvent = {
  direction: 'right',
  source: [0, 0],
  target: [100, 0],
  deltaX: 100,
  deltaY: 0,
  absX: 100,
  absY: 0,
  velocity: 50,
  vxvy: [50, 0],
  distance: 100
};

processMovement(movementEvent);
```
