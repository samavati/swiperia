# Overview

This guide documents how to get started using the `swiperia` to detect swipes in React applications. 
`swiperia-react` library is open-source. The source is available in its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/samavati/swiperia/tree/main/packages/swiperia-react).

This library contains a React component, as well as custom hooks to help integrate Swiperia into your web application (types included). 
Under the hood, this library is a React-friendly wrapper around the `swiperia-js` library, exposing types, and Swiperia instance functionality.
To read more about the `swiperia-js` library, please refer to the [Swiperia JS documentation](https://github.com/samavati/swiperia/tree/main/packages/swiperia-js).
